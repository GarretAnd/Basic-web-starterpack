## Extra Credit

Implemented a more robust image loading than just file-loader. Worked with Jared Cole to do this.  
Ended up using this article [Article](https://iamakulov.com/notes/optimize-images-webpack/) to compress the image.  
Proof of this can be shown in the following two photos.

File started off at 171 KB then shrunk down to 80 Bytes on the page.
